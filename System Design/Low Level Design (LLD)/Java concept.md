- Final : - 
	The `final` keyword in Java is a non-access modifier used to enforce **immutability** (cannot be changed) or **prevent inheritance/overriding**. It can be applied to **variables**, **methods**, and **classes**.
	
	1. `final` for Variables (Immutability) : When a variable is declared as `final`, its value can only be assigned **once**. This makes it a constant. Always initialized 
	2. `final` for Methods (Prevent Overriding)
	3. `final` for Classes (Prevent Inheritance)

- static : - 
	The fundamental purpose of the `static` keyword is to indicate that a member (variable, method, etc.) **belongs to the class itself** rather than to any specific **instance (object)** of that class.
	This means a static member exists only **once**, is shared among all objects, and can be accessed without creating an object.
