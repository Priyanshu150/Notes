Concept for solving recursion problem :- 
1. Express everything in terms of parameters (ex - list, ind, state, etc...)
2. Try out all possibilities 
3. Find out the result (sequence, permutation and so on)
4. Write the base case accordingly

**Backtracking** is a problem-solving algorithmic technique that involves finding a solution incrementally by trying ****different options**** and ****undoing**** them if they lead to a ****dead end****.
