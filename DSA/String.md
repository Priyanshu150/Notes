Approach to solve string question :- 

1. **Calculate the frequency of each  char** 
	Use freq[26]  array to calculate the frequency of each char and apply the operation accordingly.

2. **Pattern matching algo**
	Use pattern matching algo when question is asking for pattern matching of the string. Pattern matching algo reduces the time for matching each string

3. **Trie** 
	When dictionary type operation(searching, prefix) is needed use this special type of data structure.

4. **Hashing**
	Hash the string value to use it optimally
